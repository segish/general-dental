Dental Chart Templates Directory
==================================

This directory contains template images for dental charting functionality.

Required Files:
---------------
1. periodontal-chart.png - The periodontal chart template image

   Please place your periodontal chart template image here with the exact filename: "periodontal-chart.png"

   The image will be automatically loaded when users select "Periodontal Chart" as the chart type.

File Requirements:
-----------------
- Format: PNG (recommended) or JPG
- The image should be high quality and clear
- Recommended dimensions: 1600x1200px or higher (will be automatically scaled to fit the canvas)

Usage:
------
The periodontal chart template is automatically loaded as a background image when:
1. A user selects "Periodontal Chart" from the chart type dropdown
2. A user edits an existing periodontal chart (if no background image was previously saved)

The template serves as a drawing surface, and users can draw annotations, markings, and measurements on top of it.
